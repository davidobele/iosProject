Activity 1: Evaluation of top 3 ideas

1. Sports App
Mobile: What makes this app a good idea for mobile is the ability to get **real-time** updates and **notifications** witht the ability to customize the user's experience. 
Story: I believe that this app has the potential to be a everyday use app for my potential customers. The ability to get live updates and scores is essential for sports fans 
Market: This app has a universal consumer base, basically everyone who watches sports
Habit: This app will be used daily by sports to track scores and get live updates
Scope: The Challenge for this app will be to find API's to provide the data, I believe that I can build a stipped-down version of this app within the alotted time. 

2. UNCC Capacity App
Mobile: This app use of **location** and **real-time** time will provide a unique experience to the student of UNCC
Story: This app will provide good value to students currently attending UNCC 
Market: My customer base is students that go to UNCC (and other schools if I can add them). I think the student at UNCC would greatly appreciate this app idea
Habit: Idealy the average user of this app will use it daily to check the capacity of different buildings and parking lots on campus
Scope: The Image Filter App is a clearly defined product for a specific use and audience. This app will be challenging to build but I believe a strip-down version of the app it can be completed in the timeframe 

3. Image Filter App
Mobile: The potential use of **camera** (if implemented), and the customization that AI can bring to image editing are some of the things that make this app a unique product experience
Story: This App provides clear value to my audience in the area of Image Editing. Using AI to edit photos can help people who don't know how to edit manually. It can also help create more custom and unique results.  
Market: The Image Filter App has a huge market. Almost everybody can make use of this app. 
Habit: This app has the potnetial to be used daily, lots of people edit their photos all the time. 
Scope: The Image Filter App is a clearly defined product for a specific use and audience. This app will be challenging to build (especially image upload) but I believe a strip-down version of the app it can be completed in the timeframe
